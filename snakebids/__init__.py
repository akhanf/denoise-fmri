def bids (root=None, subfolder=None, prefix=None, suffix=None, subject=None, session=None,include_subject_dir=True,include_session_dir=True,**entities):
    """Helper function for generating bids paths for snakemake workflows

    File path is of the form:

    [root]/[sub-{subject}]/[ses-{session]/[prefix]_[sub-{subject}]_[ses-{session}]_[{key}-{val}_ ... ]_[suffix]

    root -- root folder to include in the path (e.g. 'results'))
    subfolder -- folder to include after sub-/ses- (e.g. anat, dwi )
    prefix -- string to prepend to the file name (typically not defined, unless you want tpl-{tpl}, or a subfolder)
    suffix -- bids suffix including extension (e.g. 'T1w.nii.gz')
    subject -- subject to use, for folder and filename
    session -- session to use, for folder and filename
    include_subject_dir -- whether to include the sub-{subject} folder if subject defined (default: True)
    include_session_dir -- whether to include the ses-{session} folder if session defined (default: True)
    **entities -- dictionary of bids entities (e.g. space=T1w for space-T1w)

    Returns: bids-like file path

    Example:

        Below is a rule using bids naming for input and output:

        rule proc_img:
            input: 'sub-{subject}_T1w.nii.gz'
            output: 'sub-{subject}_space-snsx32_desc-preproc_T1w.nii.gz'

        With bids() you can instead use:

         rule proc_img:
            input: bids(subject='{subject}',suffix='T1w.nii.gz')
            output: bids(subject='{subject}',space='snsx32',desc='preproc',suffix='T1w.nii.gz')

        Note that here we are not actually using "functions as inputs" in snakemake, which would require
        a function definition with wildcards as the argument, and restrict to input/params, but bids()
        is being used simply to return a string.

        Also note that space, desc and suffix are NOT wildcards here, only {subject} is.
        This makes it easy to combine wildcards and non-wildcards with bids-like naming.

        However, you can still use bids() in a lambda function, this is especially useful if your wildcards
        are named the same as bids entities (e.g. {subject}, {session}, {task} etc..):
 
        rule proc_img:
            input: lambda wildcards: bids(**wildcards,suffix='T1w.nii.gz')
            output: bids(subject='{subject}',space='snsx32',desc='preproc',suffix='T1w.nii.gz')

        Or another example where you may have many bids-like wildcards used in your workflow:
        
        rule denoise_func:
            input: lambda wildcards: bids(**wildcards, suffix='bold.nii.gz')
            output: bids(subject='{subject}',session='{session}',task='{task}',acq='{acq}',desc='denoise',suffix='bold.nii.gz')

        In this example, all the wildcards will be determined from the output and passed on to bids() for inputs.
        The output filename will have a 'desc-denoise' flag added to it.


        Also note that even if you supply entities in a different order, the
        entities will be ordered based on the OrderedDict defined here.
        If you entities not known are provided, they will be just be placed
        at the end (before the suffix), the the order provided.

        Note: For maximum flexibility all arguments are optional (if none are specified, will return empty string)
