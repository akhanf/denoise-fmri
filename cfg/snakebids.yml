          to the BIDS standard.

  output_dir:
    help: The directory where the output files 
          should be stored. If you are running group level analysis
          this folder should be prepopulated with the results of the
          participant level analysis.

    help: Level of the analysis that will be performed.

          corresponds to sub-<participant_label> from the BIDS spec 
          (so it does not include "sub-"). If this parameter is not 
          provided all subjects should be analyzed. Multiple 
          participants can be specified with a space separated list.
